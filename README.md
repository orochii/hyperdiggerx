# HyperDigger is a temporary name

## What dis
A game.

## Setup
I'll figure this out again lol. Install VS22 I guess?
### Stupid shit
MGCB will fail because it can't find the content pipeline DLLs to work, which will halt the build process. But it needs to build in order to create the pipeline DLLs.
Who made an egg and chicken situation and why? I will end you.
To temporarily fix this, set all LDtk files to Copy, build, then set them back to Build. I'll figure this out later.

## TODO
Enemies
